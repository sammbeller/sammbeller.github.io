  <h1>Sonnets from an Ungrafted Tree</h1>

    So she came back into his house again</br>
    And watched beside his bed until he died,</br>
    Loving him not at all. The winter rain</br>
    Splashed in the painted butter-tub outside,</br>
    Where once her red geraniums had stood,</br>
    Where still their rotted stalks were to be seen;</br>
    The thin log snapped; and she went out for wood,</br>
    Bareheaded, running the few steps between</br>
    The house and shed; there, from the sodden eaves</br>
    Blown back and forth on ragged ends of twine,</br>
    Saw the dejected creeping-jinny vine,</br>
    (And one, big-aproned, blithe, with stiff blue sleeves</br>
    Rolled to the shoulder that warm day in spring,</br>
    Who planted seeds, musing ahead to their far blossoming).</br>

    The last white sawdust on the floor was grown</br>
    Gray as the first, so long had he been ill;</br>
    The axe was nodding in the block; fresh-blown</br>
    And foreign came the rain across the sill,</br>
    But on the roof so steadily it drummed</br>
    She could not think a time it might not be —</br>
    In hazy summer, when the hot air hummed</br>
    With mowing, and locusts rising raspingly,</br>
    When that small bird with iridescent wings</br>
    And long incredible sudden silver tongue</br>
    Had just flashed (and yet maybe not!) among</br>
    The dwarf nasturtiums — when no sagging springs</br>
    Of shower were in the whole bright sky, somehow</br>
    Upon this roof the rain would drum as it was drumming now.</br>

    She filled her arms with wood, and set her chin</br>
    Forward, to hold the highest stick in place,</br>
    No less afraid than she had always been</br>
    Of spiders up her arms and on her face,</br>
    But too impatient for a careful search</br>
    Or a less heavy loading, from the heap</br>
    Selecting hastily small sticks of birch,</br>
    For their curled bark, that instantly will leap</br>
    Into a blaze, nor thinking to return</br>
    Some day, distracted, as of old, to find</br>
    Smooth, heavy, round, green logs with a wet, gray rind</br>
    Only, and knotty chunks that will not burn,</br>
    (That day when dust is on the wood-box floor,</br>
    And some old catalogue, and a brown, shriveled apple core).</br>

    The white bark writhed and sputtered like a fish</br>
    Upon the coals, exuding odorous smoke.</br>
    She knelt and blew, in a surging desolate wish</br>
    For comfort; and the sleeping ashes woke</br>
    And scattered to the hearth, but no thin fire</br>
    Broke suddenly, the wood was wet with rain.</br>
    Then, softly stepping forth from her desire,</br>
    (Being mindful of like passion hurled in vain</br>
    Upon a similar task, in other days)</br>
    She thrust her breath against the stubborn coal,</br>
    Bringing to bear upon its hilt the whole</br>
    Of her still body . . . there sprang a little blaze . . .</br>
    A pack of hounds, the flame swept up the flue! —</br>
    And the blue night stood flattened against the window, staring through.</br>

    A wagon stopped before the house; she heard</br>
    The heavy oilskins of the grocer's man</br>
    Slapping against his legs. Of a sudden whirred</br>
    Her heart like a frightened partridge, and she ran</br>
    And slid the bolt, leaving his entrance free;</br>
    Then in the cellar way till he was gone</br>
    Hid, breathless, praying that he might not see</br>
    The chair sway she had laid her hand upon</br>
    In passing. Sour and damp from that dark vault</br>
    Arose to her the well-remembered chill;</br>
    She saw the narrow wooden stairway still</br>
    Plunging into the earth, and the thin salt</br>
    Crusting the crocks; until she knew him far,</br>
    So stood, with listening eyes upon the empty doughnut jar.</br>

    Then cautiously she pushed the cellar door</br>
    And stepped into the kitchen — saw the track</br>
    Of muddy rubber boots across the floor,</br>
    The many paper parcels in a stack</br>
    Upon the dresser; with accustomed care</br>
    Removed the twine and put the wrappings by,</br>
    Folded, and the bags flat, that with an air</br>
    Of ease had been whipped open skillfully,</br>
    To the gape of children. Treacherously dear</br>
    And simple was the dull, familiar task.</br>
    And so it was she came at length to ask:</br>
    How came the soda there? The sugar here?</br>
    Then the dream broke. Silent, she brought a mop,</br>
    And forced the trade-slip on the nail that held his razor strop.</br>

    One way there was of muting in the mind</br>
    A little while the ever-clamorous care;</br>
    And there was rapture, of a decent kind,</br>
    In making mean and ugly objects fair:</br>
    Soft-sooted kettle bottoms, that had been</br>
    Time after time set in above the fire,</br>
    Faucets, and candlesticks, corroded green,</br>
    To mine again from quarry; to attire</br>
    The shelves in paper petticoats, and tack</br>
    New oilcloth in the ringed-and-rotten's place,</br>
    Polish the stove till you could see your face,</br>
    And after nightfall rear an aching back</br>
    In a changed kitchen, bright as a new pin,</br>
    An advertisement, far too fine to cook a supper in.</br>

    She let them leave their jellies at the door</br>
    And go away, reluctant, down the walk.</br>
    She heard them talking as they passed before</br>
    The blind, but could not quite make out their talk</br>
    For noise in the room — the suddenly heavy fall</br>
    And roll of a charred log, and the roused shower</br>
    Of snapping sparks; then sharply from the wall</br>
    The unforgivable crowing of the hour.</br>
    One instant set ajar, her quiet ear</br>
    Was stormed and forced by the full rout of day:</br>
    The rasp of a saw, the fussy cluck and bray</br>
    Of hens, the wheeze of a pump, she needs must hear;</br>
    She inescapably must endure to feel</br>
    Across her teeth the grinding of a backing wagon wheel.</br>

    The doctor asked her what she wanted done</br>
    With him, that could not lie there many days.</br>
    And she was shocked to see how life goes on</br>
    Even after death, in irritating ways;</br>
    And mused how if he had not died at all</br>
    Twould have been easier -- then there need not be</br>
    The stiff disorder of a funeral</br>
    Everywhere, and the hideous industry,</br>
    And crowds of people calling her by name</br>
    And questioning her, she'd never seen before,</br>
    But only watching by his bed once more</br>
    And sitting silent if a knocking came ...</br>
    She said at length, feeling the doctor's eyes,</br>
    "I don't know what you do exactly when a person dies."</br>

    Gazing upon him now, severe and dead,</br>
    It seemed a curious thing that she had lain</br>
    Beside him many a night in that cold bed,</br>
    And that had been which would not be again.</br>
    From his desirous body the great heat</br>
    Was gone at last, it seemed, and the taut nerves</br>
    Loosened forever. Formally the sheet</br>
    Set forth for her to-day those heavy curves</br>
    And lengths familiar as the bedroom door.</br>
    She was as one that enters, sly, and proud,</br>
    To where her husband speaks before a crowd,</br>
    And sees a man she never saw before --</br>
    The man who eats his victuals at her side,</br>
    Small, and absurd, and hers: for once, not hers, unclassified.</br>
