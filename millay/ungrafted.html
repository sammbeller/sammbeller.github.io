    The doctor asked her what she wanted done</br>
    With him, that could not lie there many days.</br>
    And she was shocked to see how life goes on</br>
    Even after death, in irritating ways;</br>
    And mused how if he had not died at all</br>
    Twould have been easier -- then there need not be</br>
    The stiff disorder of a funeral</br>
    Everywhere, and the hideous industry,</br>
    And crowds of people calling her by name</br>
    And questioning her, she'd never seen before,</br>
    But only watching by his bed once more</br>
    And sitting silent if a knocking came ...</br>
    She said at length, feeling the doctor's eyes,</br>
    "I don't know what you do exactly when a person dies."</br>

    Gazing upon him now, severe and dead,</br>
    It seemed a curious thing that she had lain</br>
    Beside him many a night in that cold bed,</br>
    And that had been which would not be again.</br>
    From his desirous body the great heat</br>
    Was gone at last, it seemed, and the taut nerves</br>
    Loosened forever. Formally the sheet</br>
    Set forth for her to-day those heavy curves</br>
    And lengths familiar as the bedroom door.</br>
    She was as one that enters, sly, and proud,</br>
    To where her husband speaks before a crowd,</br>
    And sees a man she never saw before --</br>
    The man who eats his victuals at her side,</br>
    Small, and absurd, and hers: for once, not hers, unclassified.</br>
