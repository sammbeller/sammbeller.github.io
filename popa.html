  <h3>Acquaintance</h3>
  Don't try to seduce me blue vault</br>
  I'm not playing</br>
  You are the vault of the thirsty palate</br>
  Over my head</br>
  </br>
  Ribbon of space</br>
  Don't wind round my legs</br>
  Don't try to entrance me</br>
  You are a wakeful tongue</br>
  A seven-forked tongue</br>
  Beneath my steps</br>
  I'm not coming</br>
  </br>
  My ingenuous breathing</br>
  My breathless breathing</br>
  Don't try to intoxicate me</br>
  I sense the breath of the beast</br>
  I'm not playing</br>
  </br>
  I hear the familiar clash of dogs</br>
  The clash of teeth on teeth</br>
  I feel the dark of the jaws</br>
  That opens my eyes</br>
  I see</br>
  </br>
  I see</br>
  I'm not dreaming</br>

  <h3> Conversation</h3>
  Why do you rear up </br>
  And desert the yender shores</br>
  Why O my blood</br>
  </br>
  Where should I send you</br>
  To the sun</br>
  </br>
  You think the sun kisses</br>
  You've no idea </br>
  My buried river</br>
  </br>
  You're hurting me</br>
  Carrying away my sticks and stones</br>
  What ails you my whirligig</br>
  </br>
  You'll spoil my infinite circle</br>
  That we haven't finished building yet</br>
  My red dragon</br>
  </br>
  Only flow further</br>
  So the feet don't walk off with you</br>
  Flow as far as you can O my blood</br>

  <h3>The Iron Apple Tree</h3>

  Where is my peace</br>
  Impenetrable peace</br>
  </br>
  The iron apple tree</br>
  Has pierced my skull with its trunk</br>
  I gnaw at it</br>
  I have gnawed away my jaws</br>
  </br>
  With its leaves it fettered me</br>
  I browse on them</br>
  I have browsed away my lips</br>
  </br>
  With its branches it hobbled me</br>
  I try to break them</br>
  I have broken my fingers</br>
  </br>
  Where is my peace</br>
  Unbreakable peace</br>
  </br>
  The iron apple tree</br>
  Has sent down its roots</br>
  Deep into my soft rock</br>
  I pull at them</br>
  I have pulled out my entrails</br>
  </br>
  With its cruel fruit it fattens me up </br>
  I bore into them</br>
  I have bored through my brain</br>
  </br>
  Where is my peace</br>
  To be the iron apple tree's</br>
  First rust and last autumn</br>
  </br>
  Where is where is my peace</br>

  <h3>Echo</h3>
  The empty room begins to growl</br>
  I withdraw into my skin</br>
  </br>
  The ceiling begins to yelp</br>
  I fling it a bone</br>
  The corners begin to yap</br>
  To each I fling a bone</br>
  The floor begins to bay</br>
  I fling it a bone too</br>
  </br>
  One wall begins to bark</br>
  To it I fling a bone</br>
  And the second and third and fourth walls</br>
  Begin to bark</br>
  I fling each one a bone</br>
  </br>
  The empty room begins to howl</br>
  And I myself empty</br>
  Without a single bone</br>
  </br>
  Turn into a hundredfold</br>
  Echo of the howling</br>
  </br>
  And echo echo</br>
  Echo</br>

    I'm no longer here<br/>
    I haven't moved from the spot<br/>
    But I'm here now<br/>
    <br/>
    Let them come in<br/>
    Let them look let them search<br/>
    <br/>
    The watermill in the shadow of the ribs<br/>
    Grinds the ripe void<br/>
    Fag ends of cheap dreams<br/>
    Smoulder in the ashtray<br/>
    I'm no longer here<br/>
    <br/>
    A moored boat rocks<br/>
    On the red waves<br/>
    A few unripened words<br/>
    Hang in the cloudy throat<br/>
    I'm no longer here<br/>
    <br/>
    I haven't moved from the spot<br/>
    But I'm far away now<br/>
    They'll scarcely catch me<br/>

    I am no longer here<br/>
    I have not moved from my chair<br/>
    Yet I am there no longer<br/>
    Let them come in<br/>
    Look around and search<br/>
    <br/>
    The mill in the shadow of my ribs<br/>
    Grinds the ripe nothingness<br/>
    Stubs of facile dreams<br/>
    Smoke in the ashtray<br/>
    I am there no longer<br/>
    <br/>
    The anchored ship swings<br/>
    On the red wave<br/>
    Words still green<br/>
    Tremble in the misty gorge<br/>
    I am there no longer<br/>
    <br/>
    I have not moved from my chair<br/>
    And yet I am far away now<br/>
    They will never get me<br/>

  <h3>Journey</h3>
  I journey<br>
  And the highway journeys too<br>
  <br>
  The highway sighs<br>
  A deep dark sigh<br>
  <br>
  I have no time for sighing<br>
  I journey further<br>
  <br>
  No longer stumbling<br>
  Over sleeping stones on the highway<br>
  I journery lighter<br>
  <br>
  No longer does the work-free wind<br>
  Delay me with chatter <br>
  It's as if he couldn't see me<br>
  I journey faster<br>
  <br>
  My thoughts tell me I have left<br>
  Some bloody some dull pain<br>
  At the bottom of the abyss behind me <br>
  <br>
  I have no time for thinking<br>
  I journey<br>
