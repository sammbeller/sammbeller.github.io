<p>It's frustrating as hell that we have always to be political but that's what it is and there's no getting away from it. Even in something as personal as poetry, there is still politics. So how should the author respond? I think there is no <em>should</em>. I think imposing an obligation on people is not the right way to go. People are already so overburdened - all of us are honestly. Rather, I think in terms of an invitation. Let us invite one another to think about our supposedly apolitical speech in political terms. In doing so, what do I learn about my poetry? My love poetry in particular? I see that, in many ways, I write in response to a prevailing climate of aggressive masculine sexuality. I see that I have struggled to accept my own agressive side, and that my writing is often concerned with concepts of predation as relates to love and sex. Knowing this <em>permits</em> me to write with greater intent, which is something I am grateful for. I do not think of it as obliging me to write in a certain way. It only opens doors for me.</p>

<p>This is key. We need to have empathy and think about the way in which we might respond when faced with the accusatory tone in which so much of this dialogue is framed. What do we gain by saying some other is <em>obliged</em> to make a particular speech act political in the first order. I think we achieve only the alienation of this other. I want to see people politically engaged, but I want to see them poltically engaged of their own volition. I want them to <em>want</em> to be politically engaged. I don't know if this more "invitational" attitude is the most effective way to achieve my goals, but it is how I want to do things. And, truly, I haven't any right to tell anyone else what to do.</p>
