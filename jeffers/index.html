  <h1>LOVE THE WILD SWAN</h1>
<section>
  "I hate my verses, every line, every word.</br>
  Oh pale and brittle pencils ever to try</br>
  One grass-blade's curve, or the throat of one bird</br>
  That clings to twig, ruffled against white sky.</br>
  Oh cracked and twilight mirrors ever to catch</br>
  One color, one glinting flash, of the splendor of things.</br>
  Unlucky hunter, Oh bullets of wax,</br>
  The lion beauty, the wild-swan wings, the storm of the wings."</br>
  - This wild swan of a world is no hunter's game.</br>
  Better bullets than yours would miss the white breast,</br>
  Better mirrors than yours would crack in the flame.</br>
  Does it matter whether you hate your... self? At least</br>
  Love your eyes that can see, your mind that can</br>
  Hear the music, the thunder of the wings. Love the wild swan.</br>
