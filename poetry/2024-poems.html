    <h1>Three Poems from 2024</h1>
    <section class="poem">
        <h2>Dream of Cold Water</h2>
        <p class="stanza">
            Every year there is an awakening into life<br />
            Every day there is an awakening into life<br />
            Every moment there is an awakening into life<br />
            If I awaken into life<br />
            With breathing or beloved sight<br />
            By the way a rain drop surprises me or<br />
            When the light falls on my face in the morning<br />
        </p>
        <p class="stanza">
            In the fall of 2020 I was in Vermont, hiking<br />
            With friends in the woods for a number of days<br />
            Swimming with friends for a couple of days<br />
            In a cold, clear, little pond<br />
            Trees lined the water there, there were trees reflected on it<br />
            And as the cold shook me I saw<br />
            Myself reflected too<br />
        </p>
        <p class="stanza">
            As if to remind me<br />
            As if I needed to be reminded<br />
            With pond water sticking my hair to me and dripping from me<br />
            And tasting good as i sucked on my mustache<br />
            And feeling good and cold<br />
        </p>
        <p class="stanza">
            So when I, in the morning, dream<br />
            I dream of cold water<br />
            And the sunlight upon it<br />
            And my reflection there, among the light<br />
        </p>

        <h1>Waxing Love</h1>
        <p class="stanza">
            My love for you is like the moon<br />
            First waxing, then waning, but coming back 'round<br />
            Sometimes hidden in the heat of the sun, but soon<br />
            To dominate again. Passing without sound<br />
            Through the sky of our lives, over and over<br />
            Seeming at times, like a scorned lover<br />
            Kept alive by a light in the bedroom<br />
            Or a glance snuck while pushing a broom<br />
            But in the moment of that glance, reigniting<br />
            As when I see you lying besides me in the morning<br />
            Or even just by the memory of the sun's rising<br />
            And hardly a moment goes by without something<br />
            Bringing to my mind my love for you<br />
            Calling me back to where I can be with you<br />

        <h1>Inman to Alewife</h1>
        <p class="stanza">
            After a run, I lay on the roof<br />
            Covered in sweat, with sweat on my face<br />
            And tears in my eyes, looking for proof<br />
            In the sky, in the clouds, some lingering trace<br />
            Of your passage through my wandering life.<br />
            It was a long one today, tracing a disoriented line<br />
            Past Inman, up Mass, all the way around Alewife,<br />
            And the pain and fatigue did a fine <br />
            Job of distracting my mind from thoughts of you<br />
            But now, on the roof, with my back plastered to the tar<br />
            I have nothing left to distract me, save the view<br />
            Of open air and clouds. I ran so far<br />
            That I thought I had left you behind.<br />
            Sunblind, I still see you in the light.<br />
        </p>
