  <section>
    Until her last breath she enlarges</br>
    Her Oxford house</br>
    Built in Slavonic</br>
    Vowels and consonants</br>
    </br>
    She polishes the corner-stones</br>
    Until their Anglo-Saxon shine</br>
    Begins to sing</br>
    </br>
    Her death is like a short breath-stop</br>
    Under the distant limetrees of her friends</br>
